'“When I was younger, I always felt out of place. I had convinced myself of the notion that the other kids knew something I didn’t. This carried on until high school where I figured out that it was the other way around. I had something that they all didn’t have. Some did, and we became friends, but most didn’t and were scared/avoided me because of it. Now that I’m in college, I know that thing I have does not hold me back. It actually propels me forward. That idea. That notion. That thing I had that they all lacked...was the ability to see the world differently.”',

'“When you have a report, make sure to follow up on it. Make sure that the data is used in some way shape or form.

If it’s business professionals in there 50’s & 60’s twitter may not be a good place to put your money for advertising. Each of these platforms have different nuances with how you advertise as well. You can’t have the same strategy with all of them, they could follow similar themes but can’t  be identical. You also run the risk of diluting the strength of each campaign if it’s spread over too many platforms ineffectively. It’s ALWAYS better to master one thing and then move to the next. Be specific. Master that market. THEN grow. Jeff Bezos didn’t start with everything when he built Amazon. He started with books and moved on from there. Let me know if you need anything else =)” -Kai Iseda',

'“Have humans come to the point where they can simulate god? I mean think about it. we play video games, write manga, make movies. Those “stories” are basically worlds of their own. So when you tie those two ideas together, you find that maybe through the creation of art and media, do we truly shatter the status of human and move into godhood. And those irl moments where you question why god is so cruel to you. Think about this. In video games we have challenges that make the game fun to play. In mangas, they always have to create conflict to keep the reader’s attention. and in movies, the conflicts are the main point of the movie.

'“People believe whatever supports their world view” -You on Netflix', 
'“As times evolve, people\'s approach to the word changes with it due to their environment and need to survive. So an example would be how you wouldn\'t act like a French colonial from the 1800\'s, people nowadays are finding new ways to adapt to their environment instead of living like it\'s the 50\'s. I mean, you support women\'s rights right? At the time, wouldn\'t they consider that mental instability? The word "instability" itself implies that there\'s a mode where you should be. A mode that is "stable." Who is to say who are and are not stable Sid? I just like to think that we're all different and that\'s neither good nor bad...just different.” -Me', 
'“Did you know that before we die, we ejaculate one last time? It does this in a last ditch effort to reproduce and continue your hereditary bloodline after you die so that a piece of you can live on. Now imagine killing yourself. Despite all the pain, the thoughts in your head, and the fact that it’s rational to end it all than live a life of pain...your body still wants to live. It wants to reach out to one last light of hope that a piece of you can continue on. This is what years of evolution has taught us. Despite whatever thoughts we have in our mind, our body keeps us grounded. Despite the limitations of our bodies, our mind lets us move past our boundaries. That is the equilibrium behind life and death.” -Me', 
'“QUICK! PICK IT UP BEFORE THE CLIMATE CHANGES!” -Me', 
'“The world isn’t bad. People aren’t selfish. Things aren’t bad. You justify the world like that because it’s the only way to rationalize the terrible things that people have done to you. You have to let go. You have to be the exception. The only way to prove your theory wrong is to be the exception. Be the person who isn’t only out for himself. Be better than how you imagine the world.” -Me', 
'“I don’t think for myself when I’m with you” -Netflix’s Insatiable', 
'“How much of yourself are you willing to change to achieve your goals?” -Me', 
'“So? What’s wrong with being weird? There’s nothing wrong with being weird. I can live with being weird. What I can’t live with is spending the rest of my life wishing I were normal. I am who I am. I am proud of who I am, and I will not let anybody tell me otherwise.”', 
'“If you ever have rat problems, just buy a lot of those hamster balls. You put them in said hamster balls, then let them roam around until they die and throw the hamster ball away. They’re cheap as hell on amazon, so it shouldn’t be a problem. Rinse and repeat. This is a method I call the “Death of Many Years.” Because the rats themselves are unable to attain any resources due to being confined within the plastic prison. As a result, they starve/die of thirst before they slowly just cease being.',
